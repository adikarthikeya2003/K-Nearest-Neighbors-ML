# K-Nearest-Neighbors-ML

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple and effective supervised learning technique for classification and regression tasks.

## Features:

Implementation of KNN for both classification and regression.

Step-by-step code with detailed comments for clarity.

Supports custom distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).

Includes sample datasets for demonstration.

Visualization of decision boundaries for classification tasks (if applicable).

## Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (optional, for comparisons or dataset utilities)

## Applications:

Classification tasks like image recognition and spam detection.

Regression tasks such as predicting house prices.

Understanding instance-based learning and non-parametric models.
